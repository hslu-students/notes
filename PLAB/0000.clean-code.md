## Clean Code

The abstraction of code increases steadily, C# is more complex than
assenbly. Less developers are required to build more complex applications.

Bad code can ruin a company and productivity sinks rapidly.
Small changes are only possible in a big amount of time.

The development team should not be ...
   ... under time pressure.
   ... not influenced by external factors.

But *what is clean code?*?

Code should be elegant and easy to read. There sould not be one
single rotten area in the code.

"Makes the code look like it was designed for this problem."

This is important because we read ten times more code than we write.
In addition every peace of code we look at should be improved.

## Meaningful Names

Use intention revealing names and don't disinform what they are doing.
Make meaningful distinctions of what a method or variable is doing
even dough they are similar.
Don't use unpronouncable names and shortages and use searchable
names. Avoid pre, postfixes. Avoid mental maping (only you know what it means)

Class names should be nouns, methods should tell what they are doing.
Don't be cute (delete..., not HolyHandgranade).
Use the same wordconcept (get..., not get, fetch, ...)
but if something is doing something different, mark it as such.
Use names which programmers know, even dought they are specific
to theyr domain. Don't be afraid to change something.
