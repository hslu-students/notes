## Package and Name

In java we use the reverse domain name (e.g. hslu.ch -> ch.hslu).
We can define a project structure with separation of concern of
what is doing what.

The typical java class structure should be like the following:

```java
public class Example {
    // members
    // constructors
    // methods
}
```

Avoid float and double if exact values are required and prefer
to use primitive types.

> Boxed primitives: `Int i = 0`, real primiives: `int i = 0`

## Garbage Collection

G1GC Garbage first garbace collector. While GC is running
the java application is halted.

The GC first looks at the joung objects (because chances are
that they can be deleted shortly after like method call)
and then at objects which are there already for a longer time.
To delete an object, remove all references and set them to
`null` so the GC knows hat to clean up.
