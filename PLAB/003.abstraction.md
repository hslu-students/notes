## Abstraction

Helps to devide code into multiple small components.
Abstract classes cannot be instanciated. When a class contains
an abstract method, the whole class is abstract.

Since java 8 we can use private methods as well, and even define
a default implementation for an Interface. This howerver is not
best practice. Interfaces do not have constructors and cannot have
state (private members).

**When use abstraction?**

 - Only abstract methods -> Interface
 - Similar functionalities -> Interface
 - Ground functionality for Objects -> Abstraction

**Datacapsuling vs Informationhiding**

 - Datacapsuling -> What is accessible (private/protected/<nothing>/public)
   - In java 9 public can be constrained to modules (what gets represented)
   - When nothing is specified something is visible for the whole package

 - Informationhiding -> How is the Information presented
